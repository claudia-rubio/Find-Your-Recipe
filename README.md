# Find-Your-Recipe
 This is my fist time using in Python ðŸ˜µðŸ˜Ž. Baby steps.  
 
 This project implements Merge sort and Heap sort to solve the same problem of sorting recipes based on how much the match with certain input fields.  
 These inputs are Calories, cooking time, number of steps in the instructions, specific ingredient and number of ingredients.  
 The user can decide to enter as many inputs for categoreies as they want or no inputs at all, and only inputs entered (if valid) will become a factor in the sorting.  
   
 The purpose is to compare merge sort and heap sort in their best/average/worst case complexities while also providing a fun and useful product.
